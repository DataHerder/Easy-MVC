Easy-MVC
========

A fast lightweight mvc framework
--------------------------------

###Quick Introduction

Really simple to get up and running.  Requires access to the command line.

- 1. Download from repo
- 2. Navigate to home directory
- 3. ./makefile.sh
- 4. Navigate to web-root
- 5. Point your localhost to that URL

###Updating Production copy

Do the same thing as mentioned above.  However the only difference is
that you simply have to copy over the library.  That's it.

###What does ./makefile.sh do?

It just makes a working site for you using the library.  It sets
up the working directories and the site structure, puts a welcome
page in there and situates files.
