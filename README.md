Easy-MVC
========

A fast lightweight MVC framework
--------------------------------

## Introduction
The whole point of EasyMVC is to have a real light bare bones MVC application
so you can concentrate on the fun stuff.  There is little to no function
base and no crazy amount of libraries to do whatever you can think of.  What
this allows is complete control over how your application will work for you.

It is designed in such a way that you can bootstrap and include whatever
codebase of functions or libraries you want.  Including namespaced libraries
is easy by coding in the autoload feature within bootstrap the specifics
on where the libraries exist.

If you want more control and less "do it for you" kind of approach with
the ability to be completely OOP if you wish or have a heavy functional
base, then this may be a good suite for you.  You are welcome to
contribute if you like it.

### Installing
Just download from git and make sure it's in a fresh folder on your
server or localhost.  Will work as is.

### Documentation
Unfortunately, there is no documentation as of yet, but that will
be coming very shortly.

### I noticed an API directory... what's that about?
That's an API library that handles API requests within the API folder.

Requests look like this:
http://my_project.com/api/main_request/sub_request/my_request.xml

The API will handle that as a request.  The documentation for this
is forthcoming.

###Coming Shortly
An update script so that on every pull you can run this
update on the directory of your application: either
php on the browser or perl on the command line

###Still work to be done
Although this version is now stable with documentation forthcoming,
there's still work that could be done.  Feedback, special case scenarios
and problem shooting is welcome.
