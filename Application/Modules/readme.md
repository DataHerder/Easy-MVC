#Module Directory

###Business to non business specific logic

Modules are classes or libraries that are not so business specific, do specific tasks that could be
applicable to many applications or libraries created by others, or codebase that's business specific
but isn't a view, or model or a directory controller.

Good examples are BCrypt classes, form classes that generate form output, Mobile Detecting classes made
by another programmer, Zend Google API library, etc...
